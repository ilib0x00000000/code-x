                          [The Climb](http://music.163.com/#/song?id=17217944)

I can almost see it

That dream I'm dreamin' but

There's a voice inside my head saving

you'll never reach it

Every step I'm taking

Every move I make feels

Lost with no direction

My faith is shakin

But I, I gotta keep tryin

Gotta keep my head held high

There's always gonna be another mountain

I'm always gonna wanna make it move

Always gonna be an uphill battle

Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose

Ain't about how fast I get there

Ain't about what's waitin on the other side

It's the climb

The struggles I'm facing

The chances I'm taking

Sometimes might knock me down but

No I'm not breaking

I may not know it

But these are the moments that

I'm gonna remember most,year

Just gotta keep going

And I, I gotta be strong

Just keep pushing on'cause

There's always gonna be another mountain

I'm always gonna wanna make it move
